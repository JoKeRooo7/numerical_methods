## Numerical methods

The purpose of this project is to study and compare several numerical methods for solving various mathematical problems. 

The following methods are considered: 

* [Approximation by the method of least квадратов](https://github.com/JoKeRooo7/numerical_methods/tree/develop/approximation_using_least_squares_methods)

* [Dichotomies (division into two)](https://github.com/JoKeRooo7/numerical_methods/tree/develop/dikhotomia )

* [Euler](https://github.com/JoKeRooo7/numerical_methods/tree/develop/euler_method )

* [Lagrange interpolations](https://github.com/JoKeRooo7/numerical_methods/tree/develop/langrange_interpolation )

* [Simpson's method (parabola method)](https://github.com/JoKeRooo7/numerical_methods/tree/develop/method_simpson)

* [Newton's Method](https://github.com/JoKeRooo7/numerical_methods/tree/develop/newton_method )

* [The Runge-Kutta method.](https://github.com/JoKeRooo7/numerical_methods/tree/develop/RungeKutta)
